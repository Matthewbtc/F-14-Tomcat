I watched a video in pluralsight (https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=maya-6-unlimited-hair-54&author=papa-georgio&name=maya-6-unlimited-hair-54-m2&clip=0&mode=live)
on how to render hair in Maya, and I chose these videos for a few maybe stupid reasons. I dont really want to jump right into 
rendering hair, or even experiment with it in my current level of experience. I honestly have just been curiouse on how hair
is made in a 3D rendering program. I have only seen glimpses of how it is desplayed, but never really seen how it was made
but always assumed that it would be a pain to render. I was interested on how hard, and how it all worked in the actual 
program. It was a very interesting series and kept my attention due to the fact it as not quite how I expected it all to work.
I thought you would have to create strand-by-strand, and I am sure there are systems that alow you to do that, if that would be
how you want to make it. I also thought that hair would display very diferently; however, it does now make sense why some games
have the hair animationseem to fall when the game loads. They apparently didnt save the animation after the initial fall and so
it falls at the start of the in game load. Very interesting video, would like to learn more on how else you could render hair.
