I watched a video in pluralsight (https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=maya-6-unlimited-hair-54&author=papa-georgio&name=maya-6-unlimited-hair-54-m2&clip=0&mode=live)
on how hair works in Maya. I chose this for a few reasons. I had thought it would be interesting to see how hair is made
in a 3D rendering program. I have never seen how it was made but always assumed that it would be a pain to do. 
I was interested on how hard, and how it all worked in the actual program. It was a very interesting series and kept
my attention due to the fact it as not quite how I expected it all to work. I thought you would have to create 
strand-by-strand, and I am sure there are systems that alow you to do that, if that would be how you want to make it.
I also thought that hair would display very diferently; however, it does now make sense why some games have the hair animation
seem to fall when the game loads. They apparently didnt save the animation after the initial fall and so it falls at the start
of the in game load. Very interesting video, would like to learn more on how else you could render hair.
